# Mobster Andorid Application
Mobster is an Andorid application based on the idea of ochlosophia, which means mob wisdom, a term used to describe the conception of the application. Essentially, ochlosophia refers to people’s tendency to offer advice to others, often strangers, as well as people’s inclination to take advice from anonymous, online sources. The goal of the application is to accommodate this idea by allowing users to ask and offer decision-making questions and advice anonymously.
